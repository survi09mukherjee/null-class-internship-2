## 🧩 Internship Tasks and Implementation Details

### **Task 1: Dynamic Knowledge Base Expansion**
**Goal:** Implement a system to periodically update the vector database with new information from selected sources.  
**Implementation:**
- Used a **sentence-transformer model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for text embedding.  
- Stored vectors in a **FAISS-based database** for efficient semantic search.  
- Added a `vector_update.py` module that automatically pulls new data from configured text or document sources and reindexes them at regular intervals.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot can seamlessly expand its knowledge base without manual retraining, enabling continuous learning.  
**Challenges:**  
Automating clean data ingestion and avoiding redundant embeddings during reindexing.

---

### **Task 2: Multi-Modal Chatbot (Text + Image Understanding)**
**Goal:** Extend the chatbot to handle both text and image modalities.  
**Implementation:**
- Integrated **Google PaLM/Gemini API** for multimodal input processing.  
- Added support for **image captioning**, **visual Q&A**, and **image generation from text prompts**.  
- Responses combine both **visual and textual** context for rich, natural dialogue.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot can understand uploaded images, describe them, or generate new images based on user requests.  
**Challenges:**  
Maintaining contextual continuity between image and text exchanges.

---

### **Task 3: Medical Q&A Chatbot (MedQuAD Dataset)**
**Goal:** Create a specialized Q&A chatbot for healthcare queries using the MedQuAD dataset.  
**Implementation:**
- Preprocessed **MedQuAD** question-answer pairs and built a **retrieval-based system** using **TF-IDF + cosine similarity**.  
- Added **entity recognition** for medical terms such as diseases, symptoms, and treatments using **spaCy’s medical NER**.  
- Developed a **Streamlit interface** for users to ask medical questions interactively.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot accurately retrieves relevant answers and medical facts from the MedQuAD dataset.  
**Challenges:**  
Handling ambiguous user queries and ensuring medically appropriate responses.

---

### **Task 4: Domain Expert Chatbot (arXiv Dataset)**
**Goal:** Build a chatbot capable of discussing research papers, summarizing content, and explaining complex concepts using the arXiv dataset.  
**Implementation:**
- Extracted metadata and abstracts from the **arXiv Computer Science** subset.  
- Embedded papers using **OpenAI embeddings** and stored them in a **vector database**.  
- Implemented a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipeline combining semantic search + open-source LLM (LLaMA or Falcon).  
- Developed a **Streamlit interface** for paper search, summaries, and concept visualization.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot answers advanced domain questions, summarizes research papers, and explains topics conversationally.  
**Challenges:**  
Balancing summarization accuracy with inference speed and ensuring contextual continuity across long research queries.

---

### **Task 5: Sentiment-Aware Conversational System**
**Goal:** Integrate sentiment analysis to detect and adapt responses based on user emotions.  
**Implementation:**
- Used a **fine-tuned BERT sentiment classifier** to classify messages as *positive*, *neutral*, or *negative*.  
- Modified the response generator to adjust tone and empathy level dynamically.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot’s responses now feel emotionally adaptive, improving user satisfaction and engagement.  
**Challenges:**  
Handling mixed sentiments in long, context-heavy conversations.

---

### **Task 6: Multilingual Chatbot with Automatic Language Detection**
**Goal:** Extend chatbot support to multiple languages with seamless detection and response adaptation.  
**Implementation:**
- Integrated **LangDetect** for automatic language detection.  
- Used **Google Translate API** for real-time translation between English, French, Spanish, and Hindi.  
- Responses are localized using culturally contextual phrases and tone adjustments.  
**Outcome:**  
The chatbot dynamically detects and switches languages, maintaining coherent, context-aware responses.  
**Challenges:**  
Ensuring translation accuracy and retaining contextual nuances across languages.
